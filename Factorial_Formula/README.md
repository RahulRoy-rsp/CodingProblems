## Problem Description

Given a non-negative integer `n`, write a formula that returns the factorial of `n`, denoted as `n!`.

### Factorial Definition:
The factorial of a number `n`, written as `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from `n` down to 1.

The formula for calculating the factorial of `n` is:

\[
n! = n \times (n - 1) \times (n - 2) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1
\]

### Example:

For example, if `n = 5`:

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

So, for `n = 5`, the factorial is `120`.

### Assumptions:
- The input `n` is a **non-negative integer** (`n >= 0`).
  
### Special Case:
- When `n = 0`, the factorial is defined as:

\[
0! = 1
\]

### Task:
Write a formula (or function) to compute the factorial of a given number `n`.
